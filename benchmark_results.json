Not because there's imminent conflict between the two biggest powers, the United States and China\u2014that isn't even a top risk, it's a red herring this year.

The most economically interventionist American administration since the New Deal will pick winners and losers at a scale not seen in modern US history. ... Beijing won\u2019t break out of its deflationary trap this year; instead, it will keep trying to export its way out, flooding global markets with cheap goods at everyone else\u2019s expense. Spheres of influence. Sell America. Eurasia Group\u2019s 2026 Red Herrings. ... These addendums for Brazil, Canada, Europe, and Japan further illustrate how global risks play out in different parts of the world, with specific implications for governments and businesses.
