Athletics and para-athletics, swimming and para-swimming, track cycling and para-track cycling, netball, weightlifting and para-powerlifting, boxing, judo, bowls and para-bowls, and 3x3 basketball and 3x3 wheelchair basketball are the sports that made the cut. ... The 3x3 wheelchair basketball will make an appearance at the 2026 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
