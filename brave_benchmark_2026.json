Gemini Pro is more generic (\u201ccombat sports\u201d), losing detail.  \n  **Best:** **GPT-5.2** (most specific/complete)\n\n- **Tech:** GPT-5.2 includes concrete examples (H200, B200, GB200) *and* adds \u201cedge-focused optimizations\u201d plus \u201cquantization breakthroughs and smaller LLMs\u201d in a crisp causal framing. GPT-4.1 Mini is close but slightly more verbose/less sharp; Gemini models are accurate but more generic.  \n  **Best:** **GPT-5.2**\n\n**Quality winner overall:** **GPT-5.2 (Flagship)** (best detail and phrasing consistency across categories; GPT-4.1 Mini is a close second).\n\n---\n\n## Overall: speed vs quality\n- **Winner for speed:** **GPT-4.1 Mini**\n- **Winner for quality:** **GPT-5.2 (Flagship)**\n- **Best \u201cbalanced\u201d pick:** **GPT-4.1 Mini** (nearly as good summaries here, while consistently faster on average)."
